# artly

Artly is simple in concept. Users have the ability to create and upload their very own drawings using our canvas tool. From there, artwork from users will be shared among other users, who can add layers onto other peopleâ€™s work by drawing on their creations. The idea is to create artwork that incorporates flair and personality from many different users, resulting in beautiful community filled with artwork, character, and happiness. As artwork gets passed around through the community, users have the option to vote for designs and templates that they like. This promotes artwork that is the most entertaining or show the most room for interpretation.
